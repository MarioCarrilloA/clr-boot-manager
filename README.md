clr-boot-manager
----------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ikeydoherty/clr-boot-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ikeydoherty/clr-boot-manager)


clr-boot-manager  exists  to  enable the correct maintainence of vendor
kernels and appropriate garbage collection tactics over the  course  of
upgrades.   The  implementation  provides  the  means to enable correct
cohabitation on a shared boot directory, such as the EFI System  Partition
for UEFI-booting operating systems.

Special  care  is taken to ensure the ESP is handled gracefully, and in
the instance that it is not already mounted, then clr-boot-manager will
automatically  discover and mount it, and automatically unmount the ESP
again when it is complete.
